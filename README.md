- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installing

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shristirajpoot/CalcVoice.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd CalcVoice
3. Install the required dependencies
   npm install
   Running the App

Once the installation is complete, you can start the app locally:
   npm start
   
This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the source code. Any lint errors will also appear in the console.

Usage
Open the app in your browser.
Click on the microphone icon or press a key to start giving voice commands.
Example voice commands:
"Add 5 and 10"
"Multiply 8 by 3"
"What is 100 divided by 4?"
"Subtract 25 from 50"
The app will calculate the result and display it. It will also read the result out loud if voice feedback is enabled.
